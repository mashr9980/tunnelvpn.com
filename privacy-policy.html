        <section class="content-section">
            
            <p>We want you to understand what information (including Personal Data) we collect in 
                connection with your use of our Services and/or access to our Site; for what purpose such 
                information is collected; how we collect, use, and store such information; to whom it may 
                be disclosed; and how you can exercise your rights and access your information, verify its 
                accuracy, correct it, and/or have it erased. Equally, we want you to know what information 
                we do not collect under any circumstances.</p>

            <p>In addition, this Privacy Policy outlines what security measures we take to safeguard your 
                information and who you can contact if you have any queries or complaints about the 
                contents of this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
            <p>Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required to 
                operate world-class Services at scale. We designed our systems (and strive to constantly 
                improve them) to not have sensitive data about our customers. We cannot disclose, 
                misuse, or abuse, even when compelled, data that we do not possess. We do not collect 
                logs of your online activity while you are connected to our Services, including no logging of 
                browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store 
                connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, 
                connection timestamp, or session duration.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with the Tunnel VPN Terms of Service (the 
                “Terms”). Together, they form a legally binding agreement between you and Tunnel VPN, so 
                please read them carefully. Unless otherwise stated, the capitalized terms in this Privacy 
                Policy shall have the same meaning given to them in the Terms</p>
            <p>Tunnel VPN’s core mission is to keep your information private. In service of this mission, 
                Tunnel VPN’s headquarters and registered place of business is in the United States.</p>
            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>Tunnel VPN may collect five (5) types of data depending on your use of the Services, as 
                follows. You can find detailed information about each of them in the specific sections 
                below. If you are just visiting our Site, please refer to Section 7.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal data submitted in association with your Account (“Personal Data”)</li>
                <p>Personal Data means any information that can be used, alone or combined with other data, 
                    to uniquely identify an individual. Personal Data is collected for the purpose of providing 
                    you with our Services, including preventing fraudulent signups or account hijacking, and 
                    may include the name, email address, and payment information that you submit to us 
                    when you create or update your Account.</p>
                <li> Aggregate Apps and VPN connection summary statistics (“Usage Statistics Data”)
                </li>
                <p>A minimal amount of Usage Statistics Data is collected in order to maintain excellent 
                    customer support and quality of service. This type of data does not include information 
                    about users’ browsing and internet activity, including while connected to the VPN—we do 
                    not collect (and therefore do not use, disclose, or store) data about the content or 
                    destinations of VPN traffic, DNS queries, or user IP addresses.</p>
                <li>Data added to Tunnel VPN Keys (“Keys Data”) (applicable only to Tunnel VPN Keys 
                    users)</li>
                <p>Keys Data refers to all the data stored within the Tunnel VPN Keys associated with your 
                    Account, which may include user logins and passwords to your services and accounts, as 
                    well as other types of data you choose to store. Keys Data is encrypted the moment you 
                    add it to Tunnel VPN Keys, and we are not capable of viewing, decrypting, or accessing Keys 
                    Data under any circumstance (even if you want us to). You may add, modify, and delete 
                    your Keys Data at any time by accessing your Tunnel VPN Keys dashboard.</p>
                <li>Anonymous App diagnostics, including crash reports (“App Diagnostic Data”) (optional)</li>
                <p>App Diagnostic Data, which includes crash reports, usability diagnostics, and VPN 
                    connection diagnostics, is anonymized data that cannot be tied back to individual users. 
                    This feature is similar to a “send bug report” option. App Diagnostic Data is not shared by 
                    default. You must opt in, such as through the settings menu of your Apps, to send App 
                    Diagnostic Data to us.
                    </p>
                <li>IP addresses authorized to use MediaStreamer Services (“MediaStreamer Data”) 
                    (applicable only to MediaStreamer users)</li>
                <p>Separately from VPN services, we also provide our optional MediaStreamer service for 
                    devices that do not support VPNs (e.g., Roku). Users who opt in to using MediaStreamer 
                    can choose to register specific IP addresses that should be authorized to use the service. 
                    These IP addresses are only used by Tunnel VPN to provide the optional MediaStreamer 
                    service and not for any other purpose.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3>Personal Data</h3>
            <p>Tunnel VPN collects Personal Data that you provide by creating or updating an Account. We 
                require Personal Data, such as an email address and payment information, so that we can 
                provide you with our Services, email you, collect payments and corresponding taxes, 
                prevent fraud, respond to support queries, and share relevant information about your 
                Account and/or the Services.</p>
            <p>Specific Personal Data collected will depend on the payment method you choose and may 
                include information such as name, billing country, billing address, and/or credit card 
                number. For some forms of payment, you may be redirected to external websites operated 
                by third-party payment processors (e.g., PayPal, BitPay, Paymentwall, Stripe, or other 
                specific payment processors, depending on your location) to complete the transaction. To 
                understand what personal data these processors collect and store, please refer to the 
                respective processor's terms and privacy policy. Payment methods that help to minimize 
                the amount of Personal Data you submit to us, such as Bitcoin, are also available for you to 
                use to subscribe to our Services. In addition, we engage with trusted partners for the 
                purposes of simplifying the login process, detecting fraudulent signups, and preventing 
                account hijacking. These partners may obtain user IP addresses, but these addresses are 
                always stored separately from systems unrelated to these purposes; can never be 
                connected to the online behavior of any user, because no record of any such behavior is 
                collected; and are always permanently deleted after 30 days.
                </p>
            <h3>Tunnel VPN uses your email address for the following reasons:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide you with access to our Services, including through password reset or verification 
                    emails.</li>
                <li>To send emails related to your payment transactions.</li>
                <li>To send you updates and announcements.</li>
                <li>To communicate with you about your Account or respond to your communications.</li>
                <li>To send marketing information, such as offers, surveys, invitations, and content about 
                    other matters in connection with Tunnel VPN that we believe may be of interest to you 
                    (“Marketing Emails”). You may choose to not receive Marketing Emails by following the 
                    unsubscribe procedure described in these emails.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tunnel VPN uses your Personal Data only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, 
                and we do not sell or lease your Personal Data to third parties. We collect and process your 
                Personal Data for legitimate interest under the applicable law, more specifically to fulfill 
                our contractual obligations to you (i.e., according to the Agreement between you and 
                Tunnel VPN).
            </p>
            <p>Any personal information associated with Tunnel VPN accounts is controlled only by 
                Tunnel VPN, including being stored on systems, servers, and services owned or leased by 
                Tunnel VPN and its subsidiaries. In the limited circumstances where this data may need to 
                be processed by other related entities, it may be shared only when required, and for the 
                duration required, for processing solely related to the purposes and legitimate interests 
                outlined in this Privacy Policy, while ensuring at all times the same data protection 
                standards. For avoidance of doubt, these circumstances do not include any situations 
                where control of personal information of Tunnel VPN users will be transferred to any other 
                related entities, including but not limited to our ultimate holding company, Kape 
                Technologies PLC, for any duration of time.
                </p>
            <h3>How We Protect and Retain Your Personal Data</h3>
            <p>Security. We have implemented best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security 
                measures with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any 
                loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your Personal Data. 
                Although we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data 
                security measures in the world can offer completely infallible protection. For this reason, 
                our guiding principle is to collect minimal data.</p>
            <p>Servers and data centers. Servers are housed in data centers with strong security 
                practices. None of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or 
                Personal Data related to your use of the Services. If any data center were to ask us to log 
                such data, we would immediately cease operations with said service provider and find 
                alternative options. Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers, 
                there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular 
                event, website, or behavior.</p>
            <p>Retention of your Personal Data. Your Personal Data—which, to reiterate, never includes 
                any sensitive data such as browsing history, DNS queries, or IP addresses linked to that 
                information or any other online behavior—is retained for a limited period in accordance 
                with applicable data protection law (for as long as we have your consent or a legitimate 
                reason for holding such data). You may request to have your data deleted by sending a valid 
                deletion request (please see Section 11). Please note that if you request the deletion of 
                your Personal Data, you will as a result no longer be able to use the Services.</p>
            <p>Legal. Your Personal Data is controlled by and stored under Tunnel VPN which is owned by 
                Grid Down LLC.</p>
            <p>How We Safeguard Your Personal Data With Relation to Service Providers</p>
            <p>Agents, contractors, and third-party service providers of Tunnel VPN (“Service Providers”) 
                may have controlled access to relevant data to help us process payments, administer the 
                Services, and otherwise assist us in operating our business. All Service Providers who may 
                gain access to such data have confidentiality and data processing obligations to keep the 
                data confidential and not use them for any other purpose than to carry out the services 
                they are performing on behalf of Tunnel VPN. These obligations include contractual 
                commitments to protect data as required by applicable laws, including those covering the 
                transfer of Personal Data from the European Union / European Economic Area to a third 
                country.
                </p>
            <p>Service Providers only have access to the data necessary for the services they are 
                performing on behalf of Tunnel VPN, which in any case will never include VPN activity or 
                connection data as we do not collect such data.</p>
            <p>In addition to Service Providers, we may share your Personal Data where you have provided 
                your consent to us for sharing or transferring your Personal Data (e.g., marketing consents 
                or opt-in to optional additional services or functionality).</p>
            <h3>Keys Data</h3>
            <p>We collect and store Keys Data only if you choose to use Tunnel VPN Keys, the password 
                and secure data manager service accessible via your Account. Keys Data stored in Tunnel 
                VPN Keys is secured with zero-knowledge encryption. No Tunnel VPN staff or Service 
                Providers can view or retrieve the information you store in Tunnel VPN Keys (not even if you 
                authorize us to do so).
                </p>
            <p>Your Keys Data is your property. You may add, modify, and delete Keys Data at your 
                discretion by accessing your Tunnel VPN Keys’ dashboard. For your protection, you should 
                create a strong and unique primary password for Tunnel VPN Keys to ensure that it is not 
                easily guessed. It should also be different from the password used to access your Account.</p>
            <p>You can import data from other password management tools into Tunnel VPN Keys by 
                following the instructions in your Account. Before doing so, we strongly suggest that you 
                review the data portability rules of your former password manager provider, as these are 
                not under Tunnel VPN’s control.</p>
            <h3>Usage Statistics Data and App Diagnostic Data</h3>
            <p>In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, Tunnel VPN collects 
                certain information related to your VPN usage, as described below. The data we collect for 
                this purpose is visible to our staff strictly on a need-to-know basis, and may be shared with 
                Service Providers for the purposes above, but is kept confidential at all times.</p>
            <p>We ensure that Usage Statistics Data and App Diagnostic Data never include any sensitive 
                information, in line with our overall commitment to never logging browsing history, traffic 
                destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries.</p>
            <h3>With regard to VPN Usage Statistics, our principle of minimal data collection means that:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.
                </li>
                <li>We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN 
                    server IP addresses they used.
                    </li>
                <li>We do not know the set of original IP addresses of any given user's computer.
                </li>
                <li>Should anyone try to compel Tunnel VPN to release user information based on any of the 
                    above, we cannot supply this information because the data does not exist.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Apps and Apps versions
            </h3>
            <p>We collect information related to which Apps and Apps version(s) you have activated in 
                order to use our Services. Knowing your current version of the Apps allows our Support 
                Team to troubleshoot technical issues you may encounter.</p>
            <p>Successful connection
            </p>
            <p>As you use the App, we collect information about whether you have successfully 
                established a VPN connection on a particular day (but not a specific time of the day), to 
                which VPN location (but not your assigned outgoing IP address), and from which 
                country/ISP (but not your source IP address). This minimal information assists us in 
                providing technical support, such as identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to best use our Services, and enabling Tunnel VPN engineers to 
                identify and fix network issues.</p>
            <h3>Aggregate sum of data transferred (in MB)</h3>
            <p>We collect information regarding the total sum of data transferred by a given user. Although we provide unlimited data transfer, if we notice that a single user pushes more traffic than thousands of others combined, thereby affecting the quality of Services for other Tunnel VPN users, we may contact that user for an explanation.</p>
            <h3>Usage Statistics Data summary</h3>
            <p>In summary, we collect minimal usage statistics to maintain our quality of service. We may know, for example, that our customer John had connected to our New York VPN location on Tuesday and transferred an aggregate of 823 MB of data across a 24-hour period. John can’t be uniquely identified as responsible for any specific online behavior because his usage pattern overlaps with thousands of other Tunnel VPN customers who also connected to the same location on the same day.</p>
            <p>We've engineered our systems to categorically eliminate storage of sensitive data. We may know THAT a user has used Tunnel VPN, but we are unable to single out the user and we never know HOW they have utilized our Service. We stand by our firm commitment to our users’ privacy by not possessing any data related to a user’s online activities.</p>
            <h3>App Diagnostic Data</h3>
            <p>With your opt-in permission, we collect anonymized App Diagnostic Data, which includes crash reports, usability diagnostics, and VPN connection diagnostics. We use this data in our network operations tools to help optimize network speeds and to let us identify problems and areas for improvement related to specific apps, VPN servers, or internet service providers (ISPs). This App Diagnostic Data we receive is fully anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual users (i.e., we do not store which user sent which data, and we do not store user IP addresses).</p>
            <p>If you opt in to share this information with Tunnel VPN (in the settings menu of your Account), we will collect the following anonymized App Diagnostics Data:</p>
            <p>Diagnostic information about if and how a VPN connection attempt failed.</p>
            <h3>Speed test data.</h3>
            <p>App diagnostics, including crash reports and usability diagnostics, without any personally identifiable information. These are handled in an anonymized form by the following Service Providers bound by non-disclosure and other contractual obligations, dependent on the platform you are using Tunnel VPN on:</p>
            <p>Windows: Sentry, owned by Functional Software, Inc. See Sentry’s Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Mac: Firebase Crashlytics, owned by Google, and Sentry, owned by Functional Software, Inc. See Firebase’s Privacy and Security documentation and Sentry’s Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Linux: Sentry, owned by Functional Software, Inc. See Sentry’s Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>iOS: Firebase Crashlytics, owned by Google, and Apple. See Apple’s Privacy Policy and Firebase’s Privacy and Security documentation. You can disable Apple’s crash reporting in iOS settings as described here.</p>
            <p>Android: Firebase Crashlytics, owned by Google. See Firebase’s Privacy and Security documentation</p>
            <p>Browser extensions: Google Analytics, owned by Google. See Google’s Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Upon activation of any of our Apps, you will be asked if you would like to share App Diagnostics Data with Tunnel VPN. You can start or stop sharing this data at any time in your App’s settings menu. On iOS, Apple’s crash reporting can be turned off in iOS settings.</p>
            <h3>MediaStreamer Data</h3>
            <p>MediaStreamer is our service for consoles and other devices that don’t support running a VPN (e.g., Roku). Because the service doesn’t run on an app and doesn’t have an option for username/password authorization, we rely on a system that authorizes specific IP addresses that you have chosen to register with us. You can register IP addresses by logging in to our Site and using the “DNS Settings” page. Those IP addresses (the MediaStreamer Data) are then stored in our system in order to identify authorized devices for MediaStreamer and are not used for any other purpose.</p>
            <p>If you do not wish to use our MediaStreamer service but have devices that cannot run a VPN, we suggest using the Tunnel VPN App for routers. Like all of our Services outside of MediaStreamer, the App for routers does not require IP address registration. Please contact us at info@griddown.com, and we will guide you through the steps.</p>
            <p>How We Protect and Retain Information Related to Email, Live Chat, and Feedback Forms</p>
            <p>Tunnel VPN keeps records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us through our Site or Services, along with our response. Depending on how you contact Tunnel VPN, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us. Having full correspondence records enables our staff to provide the best possible customer support experience.</p>
